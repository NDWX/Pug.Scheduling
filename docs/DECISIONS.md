# Pug.Scheduling — Design Decisions

Decision log for the scheduled-report-generation initiative (approved plan:
`~/.claude/plans/consider-the-following-requirements-rustling-eagle.md`). Each entry records the
decision and the reasoning, so work can resume without the original conversation.

## Context

Customers of the user's .NET microservice SaaS want reports generated on a schedule and emailed.
On-demand report generation already exists in the SaaS. Agreed shape (2026-08-19/20):

- **Hybrid landing**: generic scheduling (`Pug.Scheduling`, this repo) and generic report
  definition/configuration (`Pug.ReportConfigurations`, Phase 2, not yet started) as reusable
  Pug.* NuGet packages; report rendering, the `ScheduledReportJobHandler`, and email sending stay
  app-specific in the SaaS.
- **No `Pug.Courier`**: a standalone delivery framework was explicitly rejected — `IEmailSender`
  is an abstraction in the same domain as `ScheduledReportJobHandler` (email dispatch is that
  handler's concern). MailKit SMTP is the intended v1 implementation.
- **Report model**: static catalog + user criteria now (`ReportDefinition` with JSON-Schema
  `ParameterSchema`, kind-versioned opaque `Specification` — `native/1` now, `designer/1` later);
  forward-compatible with a user-facing designer.

## D1 — Own DB-backed scheduler; Quartz.NET / Hangfire rejected

Schedules must carry tenant (`Domain`), owner principal, and arbitrary metadata as first-class,
queryable data. In Quartz these live in unqueryable `JobDataMap` blobs, forcing a parallel app
table (two sources of truth), and Quartz cannot be decomposed into the ecosystem's
`Models/Abstractions/Data.*/WebApi/Client` package shape. The claiming/misfire/retry core is
small and fully testable; `Pug.Corea.FetchWorker` proves the worker pattern in-ecosystem.

## D2 — Composed entity model over a single `schedule` table

`ScheduleInfo { Identifier, Definition, Owner, State, ExecutionLease, Registration, LastUpdate }`
(user-specified composition). `Definition` = user-authored (domain, name, jobType, payload JSON,
recurrence, policies); `State` = scheduler-maintained (enabled, paused, nextRun, runRequested,
attempt, lastRun summary); `Registration`/`LastUpdate` are Pug.Effable `ActionContext<Reference>`
(Corea `RepositoryInfo` precedent). One `schedule` table whose column groups map 1:1 to the model
sections — user explicitly kept state in the same table ("nothing wrong with that") but wanted
the model sectioned.

## D3 — Owner is not part of the Definition (user directive)

`Owner : Reference` sits on `ScheduleInfo`; `RegisterAsync( definition, owner = null )` defaults
it to the current security principal. Immutable thereafter (not updatable because it simply is
not in the definition). Owner rule (`SchedulerBase.IsCurrentUser`): matches only
`Owner.Type == "USER" && Owner.Identifier == CurrentUserIdentifier` (user tightened the Type
check). The rule covers **creating one's own schedules** (no ACL grant needed) and view/modify/
delete of owned schedules; registering on behalf of another principal requires the CREATE grant;
all other access falls through to Pug.Authorized ACLs with domain-qualified `NounQualifier`.
Security constants (`SecurityObjectTypes`, `SecurityOperations`) live in **Abstractions** — user
overrode the Corea precedent (core project): consumer-usable constants belong with abstractions.

## D4 — Role separation: IScheduler configures, IExecutionCoordinator executes

`IScheduler` is configuration/observation only — run-now never executes anything, it calls
`IDataSession.RequestRunAsync` (moves `NextRun` + raises `RunRequested`). Resume only lifts the
pause; elapsed occurrences are evaluated against the misfire policy by the coordinator at claim.

## D5 — Workers never touch the data backend (user directive)

Regardless of hosting model, workers poll/claim/heartbeat/report exclusively through
`IExecutionCoordinator` (`ClaimDueJobsAsync → ClaimedJob { Context, Timeout, ClaimExpiry }`,
`RenewClaimAsync`, `ReportCompletionAsync( run, claimant, result, outcome )`). Due-ness, claim
semantics, misfire, retry, and next-occurrence computation are all invisible to workers. An
externally hosted worker binds the same interface to a transport client (future); the schedule
store's `GetDueSchedulesAsync` is a plain read — concurrent coordinators race for leases.

## D6 — Lease claiming is its own abstraction with its own store (user directive)

`IExecutionLeaseProvider { TryAcquireAsync( schedule, claimant, expiry ), RenewAsync,
ReleaseAsync, GetAsync }` in Abstractions. Implementation (in-memory, database — same or
different DB — or remote lock service) is transparent to the coordinator; lease state is **never
stored with the schedule** (no lease columns; `ScheduleInfo.ExecutionLease` is composed from the
provider at read time). `Pug.Scheduling.Leases` implements it over its own
`Leases.Data.Abstractions` store (Postgres/SQLite: single-statement conditional upsert
`insert … on conflict(schedule) do update … where expired-or-own`, so exclusivity is the store's
atomicity and any number of coordinators race safely). An InMemory provider was considered and
**rejected as not required**. Leases are deliberately short (default 2 min) and heartbeat-renewed
(worker default 30 s) rather than sized to job timeouts.

## D7 — Third-party handler defensiveness (user directive)

Handlers/dispatchers are "third-party" code. `JobOutcome { Successful, Details, Error }` (names
user-specified): handlers report failure by returning unsuccessful **or** throwing — the worker
catches everything, materializes `{ Successful=false, Error }`, treats a null return as
unsuccessful, and never trusts cancellation (lease expiry bounds runaways; an overrunning handler
risks concurrent re-execution). `ScheduleRun` embeds `Outcome : JobOutcome` and **keeps** the
worker-classification `Result` string (`RunResults`): TIMED_OUT and SKIPPED runs never reach the
handler, so they have no handler outcome.

## D8 — Task<T> + documented exceptions, not Pug.Lang Result

`Pug.Lang.Result<T>` is a plain value wrapper (no error channel), and `ICorea` — the newest
precedent — uses `Task<T>` with exceptions (`UnknownScheduleException`, `UnknownRunException`,
`NotAuthorized`, `ArgumentException` for validation). Followed the precedent.

## D9 — Retry identity and at-least-once bookkeeping

Side-effect idempotency keys on `(Schedule, ScheduledFor)`: retries re-execute the **original**
occurrence (carried via `IDataSession.GetLatestRunAsync`), backoff = `Backoff * 2^(retry-1)` from
now; exhausted retries record terminal failure and advance. A crashed worker's unfinished run is
**adopted** on re-claim (same run row) instead of inserting a duplicate — which keeps the
`(schedule, scheduledFor, attempt)` unique index honest under at-least-once. Reporting for a
deleted schedule surfaces as `UnknownRunException` (delete removes run history; a mid-flight
run's completion is recorded nowhere, per `IScheduler.DeleteAsync` contract).

## D10 — MANUAL trigger is first-class (user directive)

`ScheduleState.RunRequested` (+ `runRequested` column): raised by run-now via `RequestRunAsync`,
consumed **transactionally by the claim that honors it** (`ClearRunRequestAsync` with the run
insert), defensively cleared by `UpdateNextRunAsync` and `RecordOccurrenceCompletionAsync`.
Trigger precedence at claim: MANUAL > RETRY > MISFIRE > SCHEDULE. A manual request during retry
backoff accelerates the pending attempt but keeps the original occurrence. A run-now raised while
the same schedule is mid-execution is treated as satisfied by that execution (completion clears
the marker) — deliberate.

## D11 — Misfire policies

Occurrence is misfired when overdue beyond `MisfirePolicy.Threshold` (default 5 min).
`FIRE_ONCE` (default): coalesce — execute once (trigger MISFIRE), next occurrence computed from
now. `SKIP`: record a SKIPPED run (audit trail), advance, release — no execution. `RUN_ALL`:
execute, and completion computes the next occurrence from the *executed* occurrence, naturally
catching up one by one.

## D12 — Time and storage conventions

Cronos for cron math, evaluated in the recurrence's IANA `TimeZone` (DST: skipped times jump
forward); interval mode is UTC arithmetic from the previous occurrence; `NotBefore`/`NotAfter`
clamp/exhaust. Everything persisted/compared in UTC. Durations stored as whole-second bigint
columns (no TimeSpan handlers); SQLite DateTimes as invariant ISO-8601 TEXT (chronologically
comparable); `ActionContext`/`RunSummary`/`JobOutcome` as JSON text columns via
`JsonTypeHandler<T>`. Run trigger column is `runTrigger` (`trigger` is reserved in Postgres).
Deletes are explicit (runs then schedule) rather than relying on FK cascade enforcement.

## D13 — Job types: schedulable vs executable

`IJobTypeRegistry` (Abstractions) separates what is *schedulable* at the API host from what is
*executable* where (handlers may live in other processes). DI: `AddScheduledJobHandler<T>(jobType)`
(keyed scoped, resolved per run by `InProcessJobDispatcher` from a fresh DI scope),
`AddJobPayloadValidator<T>(jobType)` (keyed singleton), `AddSchedulableJobType(jobType)` for
remote-execution deployments. Unregistered job types are rejected at registration.

## D14 — Dispatch transport

`IScheduledJobDispatcher` is the long-lived transport strategy (one per worker host, not per
job): in-process v1 (no broker exists in the ecosystem; DB lease already gives at-least-once).
Future webhook shape: standalone scheduler host (WebApi + worker) with a `WebhookJobDispatcher`
POSTing `ScheduledJobContext` to per-job-type endpoints — needs service-to-service auth +
owner-identity conveyance + a completion protocol; deliberately deferred.

## D15 — WebApi surfaces

Three separately mapped surfaces, each carrying **its own route prefix** rather than relying on
the host to supply one: a host's routes cannot be assumed to be the scheduler's alone, and the
scheduler host serves more than one scheduling surface at once (user directive).

| Extension | Package | Routes |
|---|---|---|
| `MapSchedulingEndpoints()` | `Pug.Scheduling.WebApi` | `GET/POST schedules`, `GET/PUT/DELETE schedules/{identifier}`, `POST schedules/{identifier}/pause|resume|run`, `GET schedules/{identifier}/runs` |
| `MapExecutionCoordinatorEndpoints()` | `Pug.Scheduling.WebApi` | `POST executionCoordinator/JobRunClaims`, `POST executionCoordinator/JobRuns/{run}/leaseRenewal?worker=`, `POST executionCoordinator/JobRuns/{run}/completion?worker=` |
| `MapSchedulerWorkerEndpoints()` | `Pug.Scheduling.Worker.WebApi` | `GET worker`, `POST worker/pause|resume` |

- **Coordinator endpoints are the out-of-process worker's transport** (user directive): the wire
  contract is `IExecutionCoordinator` unchanged, so D5 holds over HTTP — a remote worker still
  never reaches the data backend, and due-ness/misfire/retry/next-occurrence stay behind the
  facade. Request bodies `JobRunClaimRequest { Claimant, MaximumJobs }` and
  `JobRunCompletion { Result, Outcome }` live in **Models**, not the WebApi, so a worker host's
  client never pulls in the server-side (ASP.NET-referencing) package. Renewal answers `200` with
  the coordinator's boolean: a lost claim is an expected heartbeat outcome, not a request failure.
- **Worker management endpoints are their own package** `Pug.Scheduling.Worker.WebApi` (user
  directive): a worker hosted out-of-process reaches the scheduler solely through the coordinator
  transport and must not have to reference packages it does not need.
- **Authorization stays with the facades** (see D16). Schedule and coordinator endpoints perform
  none of their own; they require an authenticated caller and map outcomes: `NotAuthorized` → 403,
  `UnknownScheduleException`/`UnknownRunException` → 404, `ArgumentException` → 400
  `BadRequestResultInfo`. Worker management endpoints remain the one exception —
  `ISchedulerWorker` is a local control surface with no facade behind it — so they check
  `WorkerSecurityOperations` on `SecurityObjectTypes.SchedulerWorker`, qualified by claimant, with
  no owner exemption.
- **`ISchedulerWorker` moved to Abstractions and `WorkerInfo` to Models** (from
  `Pug.Scheduling.Worker`): both WebApi packages multi-target `net6.0;net8.0;net10.0` and cannot
  reference the net10.0-only worker implementation. The interface stays synchronous — it manages
  the locally hosted instance, not a remote one.
- **Owner is conveyed as an `ownerType`/`ownerIdentifier` query pair** (Groups' `Subject`
  convention) rather than a new request contract; supplying one half without the other is a 400.
- **Run-now answers 202, not 200**: the request only brings the occurrence forward for a worker
  to claim.
- Query parameters the handler validates are declared nullable so omission reaches the handler
  and yields a structured `BadRequestResultInfo`, instead of model binding failing with an empty
  400 body.

## D16 — The execution coordinator authorizes its own callers (user correction)

Authorization for `IExecutionCoordinator` lives **inside `ExecutionCoordinator`**, not in the
coordinator endpoints where it was first placed. The coordinator is the worker's only surface
regardless of hosting model (D5), so putting the check in the HTTP layer would have held remote
workers to grants that in-process workers bypass entirely — the inconsistency D5 exists to
prevent. Each operation requires its `CoordinatorSecurityOperations` grant on
`SecurityObjectTypes.ExecutionCoordinator` qualified by the **claimant identity being acted as**
(`ResourceQualifiers.ExecutionCoordinator`), so one worker's credentials cannot claim, renew, or
complete runs as another. There is no owner rule: execution is an operator concern, not the
schedule owner's.

**Consequence for hosts:** an in-process `SchedulerWorker` now needs a security principal of its
own — its polls run under whatever the host's `ISecurityManager` reports ambiently, and a
`BackgroundService` has no request to inherit one from. A worker host must establish a service
principal (granted `CLAIM_JOBS`/`RENEW_CLAIM`/`REPORT_COMPLETION` on its claimant identity) around
the worker's calls. Unresolved in this repo — the mechanism belongs to the host's
`ISecurityManager` implementation, and Phase 3's owner-impersonation work covers the same ground.

## Verification conventions

Completion gate: `dotnet build Pug.Scheduling.slnx -warnaserror -m:1` clean **and**
`dotnet test tests/Pug.Scheduling.Tests` green. Tests run against real SQLite stores (per-fixture
temp DB, DbUp-migrated from `GetSchemaUpgradeScripts()`, WAL + busy_timeout). **No Docker on this
machine**: Postgres providers (schedule + lease stores) are build-verified only — SQL differs
from tested SQLite only in DDL types and boolean predicates; run Testcontainers races in CI.

## Phase status (per approved plan; pause for user review after every sub-phase)

- **1a Models + Abstractions — DONE**  · **1b Data.Abstractions — DONE** · **1c Leases — DONE**
  · **1d implementation (core/data/worker/DI + 44 tests) — DONE**
  · **1e WebApi (schedule, execution coordinator and worker endpoints, 29 endpoint tests; 74
  total) — DONE**
- **1f — NEXT**: `.Client` (Pug.HttpApiClient) over the same routes — covering **both**
  `IScheduler` and `IExecutionCoordinator`, the latter being what an out-of-process worker binds
  to; packaging metadata, README.
- **Phase 2** `Pug.ReportConfigurations` (sub-phases 2a–2e, same shape as this repo).
- **Phase 3** SaaS integration (handler + `IEmailSender`/MailKit + `IEmailSenderProvider`,
  recipient policy, output store, link-first delivery ≤ 5 MB attachments, owner impersonation at
  generation time — runs execute as the stored owner, never system).
- **Phase 4** hardening + Corea-style demo host.
